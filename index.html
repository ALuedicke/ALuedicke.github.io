                <p>Some cellular devices already have built-in trackers that allow the owner to locate them in the event that they are lost or stolen. However, there are many other valuable items that people would benefit from being able to track. Although trackers designed for specific items like cars or pets that can be purchased, there does not seem to be a way of integrating these items into a single system.</p>
